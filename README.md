# CRUD operation with PyQt5

I have created a small CRUD project using PYQt5. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. It allows us to create new records, read existing records, update records, and delete records from the Firestore database. In it when user create a document it store on Firestore database. And it also give the unique Id of the user to further read, update and delete document. For read update and delete operation i used QMeesageBox.
